# insight-on-air-bnb-Madrid
Analyzing the growth of Airbnb listings, seasonal demand, and popular neighborhoods in Madrid.
## For the following analysis i have downloaded the data from https://data.insideairbnb.com/spain/comunidad-de-madrid/madrid/2024-09-11/data/calendar.csv.gz

``` diff
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('calendar.csv')
```

# in this code we know hopw much avalaibe and un avaliable data
``` diff
data.available.value_counts()
```

# We calculate the percentage of avaliable and unavaliable date
``` diff
avi_per = data['available'].value_counts(normalize = True)*100
avi_per
```

# Counts for the busiest day!
``` diff
bus_day = data[data['available']== 'f']['date'].value_counts()
bus_day.head()
```

# Plot a bar graph to show availability percentage
``` diff
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
avi_per.plot(kind='bar', color=['green', 'red'])
plt.title('Availability Percentages')
plt.ylabel( 'Percentage')

plt.title('Top 10 Busiest Dates')
plt.ylabel('Number of Listings Unavailable')

# âœ… Room type and price is given seperately
Let`s Combine and visualize them

# âœ… Which are the top 10 neighborhoods with the most listings?
``` diff
neighborhood_counts = listings['neighbourhood'].value_counts().head(10)

# Let us see the listings on a real map
- Hotter Areas (Red/Yellow):
1- High Density: The areas that appear in red or yellow (the "hot" colors) indicate higher density or concentration of listings. This means there are more listings in these areas. These areas are likely to have high demand.
2- Popular Locations: These regions might be more popular or in high demand. They could be near major landmarks, popular neighborhoods, or central areas of Madrid where people tend to stay more often. Examples could include areas near Gran Via, Puerta del Sol, or Retiro Park, where tourists and locals frequent.

- Colder Areas (Green/Blue):
1- Low Density: Areas with blue or green (the "cold" colors) indicate a lower concentration of listings. These regions have fewer listings available and thus are less competitive.
2- Less Popular Locations: These areas might be less popular or farther from key attractions. In Madrid, this could include areas outside the city center, such as suburban districts or neighborhoods further from the major tourist spots. If youâ€™re analyzing pricing, lower density could imply that these areas are more affordable, as there may be less tourist traffic or demand.

- Density Patterns:
1- Clustered Areas: If you notice clusters of heatmap intensity in certain locations (more red or yellow), these represent hotspots. These areas are high-traffic and likely to be popular with tourists or locals. In Madrid, these could be areas like MalasaÃ±a, Sol, or ChamberÃ­, where thereâ€™s a higher volume of accommodation listings due to cultural, commercial, or nightlife activity.
2- Spread-Out Listings: If the heatmap shows a more uniform distribution of color (milder heatmap tones), it might suggest that listings are evenly spread across the region. This could indicate a more balanced demand for rentals across different parts of Madrid, such as residential areas on the outskirts or other less tourist-heavy districts, offering affordable and varied accommodation options.
